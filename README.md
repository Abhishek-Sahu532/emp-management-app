# Employee Management System

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack employee management system built with modern web technologies. The frontend is developed using Vite, React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is powered by Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The system allows users to register, log in, manage employee details, and perform CRUD operations on employee data. Authentication is handled using JWT, and the project follows best practices for both frontend and backend development.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out securely.
- **Employee Management**: Create, read, update, and delete employee details.
- **Authorization**: Routes are protected using JWT, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain functionalities.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI is responsive and user-friendly, built with Tailwind CSS and React.
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit is used for efficient state management in the frontend.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling on both frontend and backend.
- **Modular Architecture**: The project is designed with a modular structure, making it easy to maintain and extend.
